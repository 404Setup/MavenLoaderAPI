# Use Updater
MavenLoaderAPI has a builtin update tool that you can understand how it works by viewing MavenLoaderAPI source code.

Since it is not a hardcoding mode, you can also borrow this tool, such as importing MavenLoaderAPI directly and using it as dependencies.

It may be KUpdate's brother, JUpdate, but I don't want to release it alone. "Putting it together can save my energy."

My updater is very simple, so it cannot judge those items that split the loader into multiple files or publish.
