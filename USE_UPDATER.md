# Use Updater
MavenLoaderAPI has a builtin update tool that you can understand how it works by viewing MavenLoaderAPI source code.

Since it is not a hardcoding mode, you can also borrow this tool, such as importing MavenLoaderAPI directly and using it as dependencies.

It may be KUpdate's brother, JUpdate, but I don't want to release it alone. "Putting it together can save my energy."
